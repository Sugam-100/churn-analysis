# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis (EDA + Visualization)

A complete churn analysis project using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize why telecom customers leave the service.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  

To explore and visualize patterns in customer churn behavior to help businesses reduce churn and increase retention.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps  

- Cleaned and preprocessed telecom churn dataset (handled missing, categorical, and inconsistent values)
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis on key features like tenure, contract, service type, and payment methods
- Used advanced visualizations (stacked bar charts, grid plots, distribution plots) to highlight churn drivers

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Highlights  

- Churn % by Gender, SeniorCitizen, Contract, and Payment Method  
- Tenure impact on churn using histogram  
- Service combinations and churn likelihood  

## ðŸ§  Tools Used  

- `Python` (Jupyter Notebook)  
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` for analysis  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for visualizations  



## ðŸ§  Insights  

- Senior citizens and monthly contract users are more likely to churn  
- Paperless billing and electronic checks are associated with higher churn  
- Longer tenure customers have higher retention
